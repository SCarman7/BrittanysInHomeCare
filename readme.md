This project was created for my Code Louisville Course. This is actually 
my second project created after rethinking what I wanted to do.
To pull up the site you may go to "https://scarman7.github.io/BrittanysInHomeCare/".
To view the readme file go to "https://scarman7.github.io/BrittanysInHomeCare/README". This link may automatically download or ask if you would like to allow it to.
Download the link and open in note pad or any other document style application of your choice.

If you click the title it will change color as though you were requesting to go back to the home page. 
If you hover over the menu it will drop down selections for pages to navigate to in the future. CLicking the contact us link at the bottom of the page will redirect you to a webpage that lets you know it is currently unavailable.
This site will adjust based on the size of the screen and eventally become one column.
